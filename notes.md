What if:

- I get this to become a dependency of either meteor or meteor-rejects
- Use IP filtering to target only GitHub Actions
- Distribute version with malicious build/test which steals GITHUB_TOKEN from the action
- Compromises developer
- In turn inject the same malware to all their other open source packages
- Self replicate across GitHub

Concerns:

- Monetization near impossible. What will I do with a bunch of computers? Steal chrome/firefox cookies or crypto?
